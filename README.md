# Convex Relaxation and Linear Programming with Applications to Sparse Recovery
Presentation for the exam of **Optimal Control** in the **PhD program in Information Engineering** of the Department of Information Engineering @ University of Pisa, A.A. 2021/2022

> The idea for the presentation came from a Stanford class, [**CS 168: The Modern Algorithmic Toolbox**](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs168/index.html) (Sparse Vector/Matrix Recovery and Mathematical Programming) - it is also cited as a part of the references in the slideshow.
